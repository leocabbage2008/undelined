              This was a post meant for yesterday but I wasn't feeling up to it,
              we got back late. We had our physics field trip which was to an
              amusement park.
              <pre></pre>
              The way there was actually really scenic, it's close to summer now
              and the air is much warmer. We had a clear sky that day with a few
              wispy clouds. The bus was driving slowly around areas that I've
              been familiar with, growing up there. The conversation was also
              great, one girl I knew gave me an airpod to listen with. I know
              I'll remember that moment for a while, at least how it feels.
              <pre></pre>
              I listened to music with the other physics friends on the way
              there. The one girl knew iaots and crystal castles which was
              pretty exciting, I don't think she expected it from me.
              <pre></pre>
              When we got there, I lost my group almost immediately. We went on
              twister first though and I made friends with a few little
              bioorganisms. They were called Rayhan(phonetically), Logan,
              Elaina, and Sophie. They were pretty excited and we ended up
              talking some. We went on the spinny sideways one which was cool
              also, it was really fun with friends. We spun around 2 times and
              tried to do crunches/neck raises at the bottom. It was pretty
              hard.
              <pre></pre>
              On the way back we played the word game, where people take turns
              saying words that start with the letter the previous person ended
              with. It was really fun! We got back at around 7:30 and said
              goodbye to everybody.

              <h2>rant</h2>
              I've been feeling a lot of anger lately, mostly towards myself,
              I'm not smart at all but everybody expects me to be. It's just a
              lot. I've been trying to be more social lately but I feel like
              nobody cares/likes me.
              <pre>!!!</pre>
              I keep on saying that, but I only partially believe it. It's just
              like, am I really all that interesting to hang out with? talked to
              <pre>probably not...</pre>
              person about it and i kinda confessed that i might like chlorine
              to wang. relations with crystal have been better though. beck is
              acting weird lately and saying he's going to hang something? yeah
              i know. I just like hurt to many people. I asked reds sister about
              red since hes in rehab now and I really do wish for the best for
              him. Why does everyone cool have to do drugs...
              <hr />
              <h2>school</h2>
              I also have loads of stuff to do before heading off to China.
              Still 2 calc tests and english is biting my ass right now, I'm
              hanging on by a thread and we have a final essay so. Also need to
              up my game in chinese and calculus, which I both think I can get
              A's in but I'm not sure. Definitely not coming back from chem
              though.
              <h2>future updates for this site</h2>
              I might migrate to 7m.pl for the cross site migration stuff, also
              looking to set up a server soon maybe and add other pages to the
              root. I think that's mostly it, I could use the server to host
              music files which would be cool and I could serve them and stuff.
              <h2>life stuff</h2>
              I'm going to stick to this format in the future I think. Anyways
              I'm headed off to China and I'll post pics when I get back, don't
              miss me too much :D Doubt anyones missing me though with the way
              this shitty website is run. Thanks for 2024 I guess.

              Good news, Regeneron internship and MIT AI camp for a week or so.
              I might not be headed back to China though, but that's fine. Some
              more stuff that's going on, I'm thinking of getting closer to
              chlorine but I'm not sure how to do it because she's still with
              her boyfriend..
              <pre>Yeah.</pre>
              He doesn't seem to be treating her to well though so I hope I can
              be there to support her if she needs it. She also said something
              like every male friend that she's ever had has liked her and I
              don't want to be that so I'll definitely hold off for a while.
              <br />
              I also found a cool anatomy website thats pretty useful for
              drawing, I'll try to check it out later.

                so i've decided i want to get jacked, because it's a gradient,
                and i don't turn to a muscle ball completely. i'm going to try
                to bulk and then cut and then we'll see. I'm going to try to get
                the site running with timestamps and editing, so you probably
                won't be hearing from me for a while. please, i will respond to
                comments in the chatbox, ask anything, please talk to me! i'm
                lonely and express discomfort at general life. i played tennis
                today but i was just like tired, i didn't expect there to be
                practice so i was out of it, i wanted to hit the gym but i'll do
                that on friday.

                i have some other stuff in my assets folder, here's some picks.
                there's definitely more, and if you look in the webmaster todo,
                the folder structure is pretty down there so. don't be expecting
                nice folders anytime soon!
